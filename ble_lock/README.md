# BLE Smart Lock Exploitation

Research documentation for Bluetooth Low Energy smart lock vulnerabilities.

## Status

**This module is currently under development.**

## Overview

This section will document security research on BLE-enabled smart locks, including:

- Vulnerability analysis of common BLE lock implementations
- Authentication bypass techniques
- Replay attack methodologies
- Firmware analysis approaches

## Planned Content

### Topics to Cover

- [ ] BLE pairing mechanism weaknesses
- [ ] Sniffing lock/unlock commands
- [ ] Replay attacks on BLE locks
- [ ] Jamming and denial of service
- [ ] Firmware extraction and analysis

### Tools to Document

- Gattacker (BLE MiTM)
- Ubertooth (BLE sniffing)
- nRF Connect (BLE analysis)
- Wireshark with BLE plugins

## Related Modules

For similar BLE exploitation techniques, see the [BLE Smart Bulb](../ble_bulb/README.md) documentation which covers:

- Gattacker setup and configuration
- Device scanning and enumeration
- MiTM attack execution
- Packet capture and replay
